# Stylesheet Comparison Tool

This page allows you to visually compare different renderings of GitHub markdown to validate stylesheet accuracy.

## How to Use

1. **Local Preview** - Shows how this site renders with the current stylesheet
2. **GitHub Preview** - Shows how GitHub renders the same content
3. **Custom URL** - Enter any URL to compare against

Use the theme switcher to test both light and dark variants.
